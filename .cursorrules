## Current Task: Implementing Fact Submission and Storage System
Adding functionality to verify and store extracted facts in a structured format.

### Implementation Progress
[X] Set up basic project structure
[X] Create requirements.txt
[X] Implement state models (TextChunk, Fact, WorkflowState)
[X] Create LangGraph nodes (chunker, extractor)
[X] Implement workflow graph
[X] Add configuration utilities
[X] Create main entry point
[X] Improve text chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
[ ] Implement fact storage system
[ ] Create fact verification agent
[ ] Add fact submission tool
[ ] Integrate with existing workflow
[ ] Add tests
[ ] Update documentation

### Current Implementation Features
1. Advanced recursive text chunking:
   - Splits on paragraphs, newlines, sentences, and words
   - Configurable chunk size and overlap
   - Preserves context between chunks
   - Detailed chunk metadata
2. GPT-4-mini based fact extraction
3. Confidence scoring for each fact
4. Source tracking (which chunk produced each fact)
5. Basic error handling
6. Command-line interface

### Next Steps
1. Create FactRepository class for Excel storage
2. Implement fact verification agent
3. Build submission tool
4. Integrate with existing workflow
5. Add tests

### Notes
- Improved chunking using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- Added detailed metadata for chunks and facts
- Maintained simple but extensible architecture
- Added graceful error handling in chunker
- Focused on maintainability and readability
- Using pandas for Excel management
- Implementing verification before storage
- Adding proper error handling
- Maintaining modularity and DRY principles
