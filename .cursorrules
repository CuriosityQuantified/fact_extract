## Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 test revealed that our fact extraction system is accepting statements that don't meet our strict criteria for facts (no specific metrics, measurements, or verifiable data points)
- Fixed fact extraction system to strictly require measurable data points, resulting in correct handling of SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 (no facts extracted from text without specific metrics)

## LangGraph
- The `interrupt` function import location has changed in recent versions of LangGraph. Try these import paths in order:
  1. `from langgraph.prebuilt.tool_executor import interrupt`
  2. `from langgraph.types import interrupt`
  3. `from langgraph.prebuilt import interrupt`

## Current Task: Fix Fact Extraction for SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 [COMPLETED]
The fact extraction system was accepting statements from SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 that didn't meet our strict criteria for facts. This has been fixed by updating the prompts.

### Requirements [✓]
1. Ensure extracted facts contain ONLY:
   - Concrete numerical data or statistics [✓]
   - Named entities with specific metrics [✓]
   - Complete technical context with measurable data [✓]
   - Direct statements with verifiable measurements [✓]

2. Reject statements that are:
   - General observations without metrics [✓]
   - Trends without specific numbers [✓]
   - Claims about evolution or changes without measurements [✓]
   - Statements about requirements or needs without data [✓]
   - Future predictions or possibilities without concrete data [✓]

### Implementation Progress
[X] Identify issue with fact extraction from SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5
[X] Update fact extractor prompt to be more strict
[X] Update fact verification prompt to reject non-measurable statements
[X] Test changes with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5
[X] Verify no facts are extracted from the article

### Changes Made
1. Fact Extractor Prompt:
   - Added strict requirements for specific metrics and measurements
   - Added new examples of invalid facts without metrics
   - Enhanced criteria for rejecting statements without data
   - Added more specific checks for numerical values

2. Fact Verification Prompt:
   - Added strict requirements for measurable data
   - Added new examples of false positives without metrics
   - Enhanced rejection criteria for non-quantifiable statements
   - Added more specific checks for numerical values

### Results
- System now correctly identifies that SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 contains no valid facts
- All statements without specific metrics are properly rejected
- Test confirms no facts are extracted from the article
- Prompts successfully enforce requirement for measurable data

### Next Steps
1. Consider testing with other articles to ensure we haven't made the criteria too strict
2. Update documentation to reflect the stricter requirements
3. Consider adding more test cases specifically for metric requirements

### Notes
- Current system is accepting general statements about:
  * Cloud security evolution
  * Organization requirements
  * Mobile device security trends
  * Future technology impacts
- None of these statements contain concrete, measurable data
- Need to make fact criteria more strict
- Focus on requiring specific metrics and measurements
