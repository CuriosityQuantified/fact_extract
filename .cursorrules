## Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 test revealed that our fact extraction system is accepting statements that don't meet our strict criteria for facts (no specific metrics, measurements, or verifiable data points)
- Fixed fact extraction system to strictly require measurable data points, resulting in correct handling of SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 (no facts extracted from text without specific metrics)
- Updated metric requirements to allow one clear, measurable metric (instead of two) while maintaining high standards for context and specificity, successfully tested with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6
- When using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, always create proper Document objects with page_content attribute before passing to split_documents() or transform_documents() methods to avoid "'dict' object has no attribute 'page_content'" errors

## LangGraph
- The `interrupt` function import location has changed in recent versions of LangGraph. Try these import paths in order:
  1. `from langgraph.prebuilt.tool_executor import interrupt`
  2. `from langgraph.types import interrupt`
  3. `from langgraph.prebuilt import interrupt`

## Current Task: Fact Extraction System Enhancement [COMPLETED]
Implementing requested modifications to the fact extraction system.

### Requirements [✓]
1. Update chunking process to use words instead of characters [✓]
   - Changed to 750 word chunks with 50 word overlaps
   - Updated length_function to count words instead of characters
   - Verified with test script

2. Fix toggle behavior in GUI progress window [✓]
   - Added persistent-details CSS class to prevent auto-closing
   - Added custom CSS to ensure details elements stay open
   - Implemented JavaScript with MutationObserver to track and maintain toggle states
   - Added unique IDs to each details element for better state tracking
   - Created helper method to consistently apply JavaScript after each update
   - Replaced HTML details/summary with Gradio's native Accordion and Tabs components for better reliability
   - Implemented a completely new tab-based interface for better visibility and accessibility

3. Change "All Facts" to "All Submissions" [✓]
   - Updated terminology throughout the GUI
   - Ensured consistent use of "submissions" vs "facts"

4. Fix GUI error with gr.Column parameter [✓]
   - Removed invalid 'label' parameter from gr.Column constructor
   - Added a Markdown heading inside the column instead
   - Verified the GUI runs without errors

### Implementation Details
1. Chunking Changes:
   - Modified RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter configuration in nodes.py
   - Changed length_function to use word count: `lambda x: len(x.split())`
   - Updated chunk_size to 750 and chunk_overlap to 50
   - Created test_word_chunker.py to verify the implementation

2. GUI Toggle Fix:
   - Added 'persistent-details' CSS class to all details elements
   - Added custom CSS to improve details appearance and styling
   - Implemented JavaScript with MutationObserver to track open/closed states
   - Added unique IDs to each details element for reliable state tracking
   - Created format_facts_with_script helper method to ensure JavaScript runs after each update
   - Used setTimeout to ensure DOM updates complete before restoring states
   - Replaced HTML details/summary elements with Gradio's native Accordion and Tabs components
   - Implemented update_facts_display function to rebuild components with proper state
   - Completely redesigned the facts display using a dedicated tab-based interface
   - Created separate tabs for All Submissions, Approved Facts, Rejected Submissions, and Errors
   - Used Markdown formatting for better readability and consistency

3. Terminology Updates:
   - Changed "All Facts" to "All Submissions" in collapsible section headers
   - Updated status messages to use consistent terminology
   - Maintained "Facts" for verified items and "Submissions" for all items

4. GUI Error Fix:
   - Identified error: gr.Column() doesn't accept a 'label' parameter
   - Removed the invalid parameter and added a Markdown heading inside the column
   - Tested the fix to ensure the GUI runs without errors

### Testing
- Created and ran test_word_chunker.py to verify word-based chunking
- Confirmed proper chunk sizes (750 words) and overlaps (50 words)
- Verified all content is properly included in the chunks
- Manually tested toggle behavior to ensure details elements stay open when new facts are added
- Verified the GUI runs without errors after fixing the gr.Column parameter issue
- Tested the new tab-based interface for displaying facts
- Added debug information to help troubleshoot display issues

### Next Steps
[ ] Consider adding more robust error handling for document processing
[ ] Add unit tests specifically for the chunking functionality
[ ] Update documentation with best practices for using LangChain text splitters
[ ] Improve the UI/UX with additional Gradio components for better visualization
[ ] Add filtering and sorting options for facts in the GUI
[ ] Implement export functionality for extracted facts

## Previous Task: Fix Chunking Error in Fact Extraction System [COMPLETED]
Fixing the error "Error in chunking: 'dict' object has no attribute 'page_content'" in the fact extraction workflow.

### Requirements [✓]
1. Identify the root cause of the chunking error [✓]
2. Fix the chunking implementation [✓]
3. Test the fix with a simplified test script [✓]
4. Verify the fix works with the full workflow [✓]

### Findings
1. Root Cause:
   - In `chunker_node` function, dictionaries were being passed directly to `transform_documents()`
   - LangChain's text splitters expect Document objects with a `page_content` attribute
   - The GUI implementation was correctly creating Document objects, but the main workflow wasn't

2. Solution:
   - Modified `chunker_node` to create proper Document objects before passing to the text splitter
   - Changed from using `transform_documents([{...}])` to `split_documents([Document(...)])`
   - Added proper imports for the Document class

3. Test Results:
   - Created a simplified test script (`test_chunker.py`) that verified the fix works
   - Ran the full extraction test which successfully processed the text without errors
   - The chunker now correctly splits text into manageable chunks

### Code Changes
```python
# Before:
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # ... configuration ...
).transform_documents([{
    "page_content": state["input_text"],
    "metadata": {
        "source": state["document_name"],
        "url": state["source_url"]
    }
}])

# After:
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # ... configuration ...
)

# Create a proper Document object
from langchain_core.documents import Document
initial_doc = Document(
    page_content=state["input_text"],
    metadata={
        "source": state["document_name"],
        "url": state["source_url"]
    }
)

# Split the document
text_splitter = text_splitter.split_documents([initial_doc])
```

### Next Steps
[ ] Consider adding more robust error handling for document processing
[ ] Add unit tests specifically for the chunking functionality
[ ] Update documentation with best practices for using LangChain text splitters

## Previous Task: Test Updated Fact Extraction Prompts with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6 [COMPLETED]
Testing the fact extraction system with updated prompts that require one clear, measurable metric instead of two.

### Requirements [✓]
1. Ensure extracted facts contain:
   - At least ONE concrete numerical data point [✓]
   - Complete technical context [✓]
   - Proper units for all measurements [✓]
   - Full proper names for entities [✓]

2. Reject statements that:
   - Lack specific metrics [✓]
   - Have no measurable data points [✓]
   - Cannot be independently verified [✓]

### Test Results
[X] Clear processed chunks
[X] Run test with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6
[X] Verify correct fact extraction
[X] Confirm proper fact verification

### Findings
1. Successfully Verified Fact:
   - TSMC's 1-nanometer process node achievement
   - Contains specific metrics:
     * Transistor density: 400M/mm²
     * Power efficiency: 0.2W/M transistors
   - Includes proper context and entity names

2. Correctly Rejected Fact:
   - EUV lithography adoption statement
   - Rejected due to:
     * No specific metrics
     * Lack of measurable data
     * No concrete, testable claims

### Conclusion
- Updated prompts are working as intended
- Balance achieved between strictness and practicality
- Maintains high standards for fact verification while allowing reasonable flexibility

### Next Steps
[ ] Consider testing with more diverse articles
[ ] Monitor for any edge cases
[ ] Update documentation with new criteria

### Notes
- Current system is accepting general statements about:
  * Cloud security evolution
  * Organization requirements
  * Mobile device security trends
  * Future technology impacts
- None of these statements contain concrete, measurable data
- Need to make fact criteria more strict
- Focus on requiring specific metrics and measurements
