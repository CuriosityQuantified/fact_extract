## Current Task: Implementing Core LangGraph Workflow
Creating a simple but well-structured fact extraction system using LangGraph.

### Implementation Progress
[X] Set up basic project structure
[X] Create requirements.txt
[X] Implement state models (TextChunk, Fact, WorkflowState)
[X] Create LangGraph nodes (chunker, extractor)
[X] Implement workflow graph
[X] Add configuration utilities
[X] Create main entry point
[X] Improve text chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
[ ] Test the implementation
[ ] Add error handling improvements
[ ] Add documentation

### Current Implementation Features
1. Advanced recursive text chunking:
   - Splits on paragraphs, newlines, sentences, and words
   - Configurable chunk size and overlap
   - Preserves context between chunks
   - Detailed chunk metadata
2. GPT-4-mini based fact extraction
3. Confidence scoring for each fact
4. Source tracking (which chunk produced each fact)
5. Basic error handling
6. Command-line interface

### Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with sample text
2. Add better error handling and logging
3. Fine-tune chunking parameters if needed
4. Add fact validation
5. Add structured output formats (CSV/Excel)

### Code Structure
```

```

### Notes
- Improved chunking using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- Added detailed metadata for chunks and facts
- Maintained simple but extensible architecture
- Added graceful error handling in chunker
- Focused on maintainability and readability
