## Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 test revealed that our fact extraction system is accepting statements that don't meet our strict criteria for facts (no specific metrics, measurements, or verifiable data points)
- Fixed fact extraction system to strictly require measurable data points, resulting in correct handling of SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5 (no facts extracted from text without specific metrics)
- Updated metric requirements to allow one clear, measurable metric (instead of two) while maintaining high standards for context and specificity, successfully tested with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6

## LangGraph
- The `interrupt` function import location has changed in recent versions of LangGraph. Try these import paths in order:
  1. `from langgraph.prebuilt.tool_executor import interrupt`
  2. `from langgraph.types import interrupt`
  3. `from langgraph.prebuilt import interrupt`

## Current Task: Test Updated Fact Extraction Prompts with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6 [COMPLETED]
Testing the fact extraction system with updated prompts that require one clear, measurable metric instead of two.

### Requirements [✓]
1. Ensure extracted facts contain:
   - At least ONE concrete numerical data point [✓]
   - Complete technical context [✓]
   - Proper units for all measurements [✓]
   - Full proper names for entities [✓]

2. Reject statements that:
   - Lack specific metrics [✓]
   - Have no measurable data points [✓]
   - Cannot be independently verified [✓]

### Test Results
[X] Clear processed chunks
[X] Run test with SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6
[X] Verify correct fact extraction
[X] Confirm proper fact verification

### Findings
1. Successfully Verified Fact:
   - TSMC's 1-nanometer process node achievement
   - Contains specific metrics:
     * Transistor density: 400M/mm²
     * Power efficiency: 0.2W/M transistors
   - Includes proper context and entity names

2. Correctly Rejected Fact:
   - EUV lithography adoption statement
   - Rejected due to:
     * No specific metrics
     * Lack of measurable data
     * No concrete, testable claims

### Conclusion
- Updated prompts are working as intended
- Balance achieved between strictness and practicality
- Maintains high standards for fact verification while allowing reasonable flexibility

### Next Steps
[ ] Consider testing with more diverse articles
[ ] Monitor for any edge cases
[ ] Update documentation with new criteria

### Notes
- Current system is accepting general statements about:
  * Cloud security evolution
  * Organization requirements
  * Mobile device security trends
  * Future technology impacts
- None of these statements contain concrete, measurable data
- Need to make fact criteria more strict
- Focus on requiring specific metrics and measurements
