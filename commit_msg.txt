[Cursor] Enhanced fact extraction and verification prompts

Enhanced the fact extraction system to be more strict about requiring measurable data points while maintaining reasonable acceptance criteria:

1. Added strong personas for both agents:
   - Dr. Victoria Blackwood for verification (The Fact Assassin)
   - Dr. Marcus Chen for extraction (The Data Purist)

2. Strengthened fact criteria:
   - Require at least ONE specific metric with proper context
   - Require FULL proper names for entities
   - Require units for ALL numerical values
   - Require test conditions/context for ALL measurements
   - Added emphasis on technical context completeness

3. Added verification/extraction processes:
   - Step-by-step procedures for evaluating facts
   - More rigorous checks for completeness
   - Stronger emphasis on direct verification

4. Enhanced few-shot examples:
   - Updated examples to demonstrate proper metric requirements
   - Added more detailed reasoning for rejections
   - Emphasized proper handling of related measurements

5. Added test files:
   - test_cybersecurity.py for SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5
   - test_semiconductor.py for SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6

Tested and verified:
- SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_5: Correctly rejects all statements (no measurable data)
- SYNTHETIC_ARTICLE_6: Correctly extracts and verifies facts with proper metrics and context
